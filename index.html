                                Computer hardware and cpu architecture has always been something that intrigued me. From designing basic logic circuits
                                to learning how each component of a CPU interacts with each other, designing my own cpu from scratch 
                                has always been a goal of mine. After completing a couple of courses in analog electronics, digital logic, and 
                                computer organization, I embarked on a journey to built an 8-bit cpu completely from scratch on a breadboard; here is the result. <br><br>

                                This breadboard computer followed the SAP-1 (Simple as Possible 1) architecture as introduced by Albert Paul Malvino. This very basic
                                model of the computer processor contains only the basic necessities for a functional microprocessor, nevertheless, it is an interesting
                                architecture to follow for the purposes of building one completely from scratch. <br><br>

                                The cpu is built using low level Texas Intruments 74LS series TTL logic chips running on 5V logic. The cpu is composed of a 500hz clock,

                                and control logic built using EEPROMS. One of the main goals I wanted for this cpu was for it to be Turing complete, thereby giving it the 
                                capability to carry out any possible computable sequence. In order to accomplish this, I needed to give the computer an instruction set 
                                mimicing that of a Turing machine by introducing conditional branch instructions. This cpu is capable of performing addtion, subtraction, loading, storing, halting, outputting, branching,
                                as well as conditional branching to satisfy the requirements of Turing completeness.<br><br>

                                <strong> Inspiration </strong> <br>
                                When the Fort McMurray fires of 2016 destroyed over 3244 homes and caused 9.9 billion USD in damages, our team was inspired to seek new and 
                                novel technologies to transoform the way we tackle firefighting. <br><br>

                                <strong> Concept </strong> <br>
                                Guardian is an IoT enabled firefighter helmet that sends and retrieves information by using six sensors connected to a central microcontroller 
                                capable of connecting to nearby WiFi networks. When information from the environment is extracted, we are capable of sending 
                                this information using WiFi following the IOT protocol to a remote real-time database where it is stored and processed. When 
                                this information is retrieved, it is used to create a web user interface that displays the information in a real-time framework 
                                to show changes as they happen. This interface allows all subscribers to the web app to monitor the situation different firefighters 
                                are and providing assistance when needed. <br><br>

                                <strong> Specifications </strong> <br>
                                The microcontroller we used for this project is the NodeMCU board which is an Internet of Things enabled board built on top of the Arduino 
                                framework. We then attached several sensors to the board (DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor, CCS811 Air Quality Sensor, BME280 Atmospheric and 
                                Pressure Sensor, and VEML6070 UV Index Sensor) following the I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) protocol where we used a multi-master/multi-slave architecture 
                                to allow sensors to publish and receive data to the bus system. When the data is received by the NodeMCU microcontroller, the data is sent over WiFi to a 
                                real-time Google Firebase database where it is categorized by sensor and type of data. This information is then retrieved and displayed on a web app user 
                                interface updated in real-time. The web app is built using the Vue.js framework to process the real-time data. Other areas of the web app such as the 
                                front-end design are built using the HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. Additional features were implemented using Bootstrap, and ApexGraphs.<br><br>

                                </strong>

                                The issue of waste management is something that many people view as trivial, yet it is one of the fundamental factors that 
                                will decide the liveability of the world. Even in Canada, a developed country, only 9% of plastics are recycled, meaning 
                                that the equivalent of 24 CN towers of recyclable plastic enters our landfills each year. In developing nations, this is 
                                an even more serious issue that can have profound impacts on quality of life. <strong> DetritusAI is a solution for modern smart 
                                city urban waste collection. Our team sought to tackle the challenges cities face with waste collection and waste disposal, 
                                hoping to optimize waste collection routes using machine learning and IoT.</strong> <br><br>

                                Detritus AI is a smart, end-to-end, waste disposal system that detects and categorizes objects as either waste or recycling to
                                help users correctly identify and dispose of their garbage and sends the capacity of each garbage/recycling container to a 
                                <strong> remote cloud service which leverages the IoT data to optimize garbage collection routes. </strong> After the computer vision model is run 
                                and the object is classified, the respective container lid (either trash or waste) will open automatically prompting the user 
                                to dispose of their garbage in the proper container. Additionally, the smart garbage cans will transmit essential information 
                                such as waste levels and location to a route optimization algorithm which takes into account the capacity and the distance 
                                between containers - allowing for the optimization of garbage routes. DetritusAI tracks the quantity of waste that is in each 
                                container and communicates with the client-side applications used by garbage truck drivers to determine how full each container is.
                                <strong>Based on the capacity of each garbage can and its location, DetritusAI calculates the optimal route for garbage trucks to collect
                                garbage while minimizing distance and time, even taking into account traffic. This project not only helps users correctly dispose 
                                of their waste but more importantly reduces the time needed for garbage collection personnel to collect the waste thereby improving 
                                efficiency, reducing pollution, and creating a smarter, greener city. </strong> <br><br>

                                Fireguard is an Internet of Things solution designed to detect and prevent forest fires at the instant they arise. 
                                By placing this tool in different places in the forest, we are able to monitor important vitals about the environment
                                and detect sudden changes in temperature, CO2 levels, atmospheric pressure and volume of total organic compounds. We 
                                then retrieved this information and created a unique web user interface that responded to the real-time changes in data
                                to relay information across all individuals over watching the situation. <br><br>

                                The scope of this project was: <br>

                                ‚Ä¢ A hardware device that monitors environment conditions<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ A dashboard that allows one to monitor the status of all the beacons and alert EMS if they detect sudden changes in environment conditions<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ Geofencing integration to alert others in the area to leave before the situation gets out of hand<br><br>

                                <strong> Machine Learning: </strong> (time series forecasting) The machine learning aspect one which we believed could play a key role in our solution yet needed a 
                                strong use case for. Initially, we wanted to use an attached camera and the google cloud vision API to confirm fires and reduce the number of false 
                                positives created by this data. After some thought, we realized that this would be a misuse of the data we collect and decided to use time series 
                                forecasting. This model works by detecting sudden changes in data in order to detect anomalies. We used a seasonality change model to account for 
                                large variations slowly brought upon over large amounts of time, such as season changes. In order to test, we simulated a fire on our device and 
                                tracked the data in a csv file. That data was passed into the model and the anomalies were rendered on our alert dashboard.<br><br>

                                <strong> Web View: </strong>The information on Google Firebase is then retrieved and displayed on a web app user interface updated in real-time taking advantage of 
                                the Google Maps API. The web app is built using the Vue.js framework to process the real-time data. Other areas of the web app such as the front-end 
                                design are built using the HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. Additional features were implemented using Bootstrap, and ApexGraphs.<br><br>

                                <strong> Hardware: </strong> To accomplish the goals of FireGuard, we chose to use the NodeMCU which is an IoT (Internet of Things) enabled microcontroller built on 
                                top of the Arduino framework. We attached several sensors to the board to help us gather the vital environmental data needed to be sent to Google 
                                Cloud's Firebase Database. Some of these sensors included the DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor, CCS811 Air Quality Sensor, VEML 6070 UV Index
                                Sensor, SparkFun Soil Moisture Sensor, and the TCS34725 RGB Sensor. This combination of sensors and an IoT enabled microcontroller enables us to 
                                gather and upload data in a lightweight and efficient format, reducing latency and overhead in emergency situations.<br><br>

                                <strong> Data Base: </strong> The data is received by the NodeMCU microcontroller is sent to a real-time Google Firebase database where it is categorized by sensor
                                and type of data.<br><br>
